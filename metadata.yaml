description: "A Little Princess is a children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett,\
  \ first published as a book in 1905. It is an expanded version of the short story\
  \ Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's, which was serialized in St. Nicholas\
  \ Magazine from December 1887. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902\
  \ play A Little Un-fairy Princess based on that story, her publisher asked that\
  \ she expand the story as a novel with \"the things and people that had been left\
  \ out before\". The novel was published by Charles Scribner's Sons (also publisher\
  \ of St. Nicholas) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title\
  \ A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the\
  \ First Time.\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association\
  \ named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it\
  \ was ranked number 56 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by\
  \ School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. It was the second\
  \ of two Burnett novels among the Top 100, with The Secret Garden number 15.\n From\
